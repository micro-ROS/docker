# micro-ROS Dockers

This repository contains Docker-related material aimed at setting up, configuring and developing a [micro-ROS](https://microros.github.io/)-based application.

This set of Dockerfiles provides ready-to-use environments to easily execute micro-ROS examples in your host machine, as well as to use the standalone [micro-ROS build system](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup).
In addition, two images are provided that allow using micro-ROS as an external library, both in [ESP-IDF](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_espidf_component/tree/foxy/docker) and within [Arduino IDE](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_arduino/tree/foxy/extras/library_generation).

The Docker images can be found at [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/microros).

The avaiable images are listed below:

## Pre-requisites

You need to have **Docker** in your system.
For installing Docker, refer to the official documentation at https://www.docker.com/.

## Usage

To get an image, use the `docker pull` command:

* e.g. `docker pull microros/base`

You can select the preferred tag by appending `:tag` to the image name

* e.g. `docker pull microros/base:foxy`

Once you have the image locally, type `docker run` to start it. It is not mandatory, although usually useful, to launch your containers using the `--rm` and `--net=host` flags:

* e.g. `docker run -it --rm --net=host microros/micro-ros-agent:foxy`

`--rm` makes sure that the docker image will be removed after exiting.
`--net=host` provides the container with the same network access as the host.
`-it` allocates a pseudo-TTY for you and keeps stdin listening.
Another used command is `-v` to map local files with docker container ones.
`-v` is useful in case you may want to flash boards from within a Docker container.

#### base image

It is the base for the rest of the containers.
It contains the necessary micro-ROS setup tools and dependencies.
From this image, you can start any development targeting micro-ROS.


#### micro-ros-agent

This image is meant to be used as a stand-alone application.
It includes the installation of the ROS 2 version selected by the tag selected, together with a micro-ROS Agent.
The entry point of this image is directly the micro-ROS Agent, so upon execution of `docker run` you will be facing the micro-ROS Agent command line input. Running:

* e.g. `docker run -it --net=host microros/micro-ros-agent:foxy udp4 -p 9999`

will start a micro-ROS Agent listening to UDP messages on port 9999.

#### micro-ros-demos

`micro-ros-demos` is one of the example images.
With this image, you can launch example applications using micro-ROS (compiled for Linux machines).
This image entry point has a ROS 2 environment set up with micro-ROS examples.
You can run regular ROS 2 tools to launch the examples.

* eg: `docker run -it --net=host microros/micro-ros-demos bash`

The currently available examples are listed [here](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS-demos/rclc).

#### micro-ros-olimex-nuttx (unmaintained)

This image provides you with a ready-to-flash firmware for Olimex-STM32-E407 boards with demos included.
To be able to flash, you need to map your devices to the Docker container as follows:

* e.g. `docker run -it --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb microros/micro-ros-olimex-nuttx:foxy`

Once inside the container, you can flash the board by running `scripts/flash.sh` from the `firmware/NuttX` directory.

There you can find a publisher and a subscriber examples.
Both examples use serial transport to communicate with a micro-ROS Agent, so you should start an Agent with the same transport (You can use the `micro-ros-agent` image to do so).
Once a Client-Agent communication is established you can use ROS 2 tools to view the publications from the Olimex or to publish messages to it.

## Automated builds

These Dockerfiles are used for automatically creating images on Docker Hub.
These builds are tagged with the ROS 2 version they will be compatible with: e.g. dashing, foxy...
The latest tag will always correspond to the latest release of ROS 2.

These automatic builds have a direct relationship with the content of the micro-ROS repositories:

 Image | Triggers
-|-
base | https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS-build
micro-ros-agent | https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS-Agent <br> https://github.com/eProsima/Micro-XRCE-DDS-Agent
micro-ros-demos | https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro-ROS-demos
micro_ros_arduino_builder | https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_arduino
esp-idf-microros | https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_espidf_component

Apart from GitHub repositories changes, a build can be triggered whenever the base image is updated on Docker Hub.
Base images are specified with the `FROM:` directive in the Dockerfile.
